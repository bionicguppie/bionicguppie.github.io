This blog is a way for me to collect all the questions and information I have about Cloud Security. I'll start with the questions:

-How is it different from traditional network security?
-What kind of risks does Cloud infrastructure create?
-How to remain vigilant to new and changing Cloud risks?

### The Future

I'll collect here information and news that I find in my journey into Cloud Security
