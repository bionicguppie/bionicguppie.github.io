title: What is Cloud Computing?

## What Do We Mean When We Talk About Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing currently means "the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user." What this means is that a business, the cloud provider, offers you use of their compute resources for a fee. The cloud provider manages the underlying physical resources, such as power, cooling, physical security, and physical maintenance, at a minimum. 

The technology that supports cloud computing is not new. Virtualization and remote access have been available since at least the 1990s, but it wasn't until Amazon started Amazon Web Services in the mid 2000s that cloud services based around operational expenditures rather than capital expenditures became available. Before this, if a new company needed an IT infrastructure, they need to pay for the servers, equipment, and software upfront. They would also have to maintain those themselves. This creates a static IT environment, where the company either has too much equipment and are wasting money, or too little equipment and can't keep up with demand. With cloud services, a new company can immediatly have the infrastructure they need and are able to quickly scale up or scale down resources according to demand.

Cloud computing also supports hybrid environments. A company can have a much smaller It environment that it maintains themselves, while utilizing the scaling capabilities of the cloud as needed. This is useful when you have information you don't want in the cloud, but still want the cost savings and flexibility the cloud provides. 

Cloud computing is incredibly useful for large and small businesses alike. However, as we'll see in this exploration, it's flexibity and cast savings have their own risks.
