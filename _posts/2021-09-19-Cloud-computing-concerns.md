## Cloud computing is convenient, but there aspects to watch out for.

The biggest area of risk that a company should be aware of when starting with a cloud provider, is that the cloud providor has access to your data, and can provide that data to third parties, depending on the end user agreement the user signs, and any legal frameworks the cloud provider exists within. Similarly, if the cloud provider has a data breach, that also puts your data at risk. There are methods that you can use to protect the data, including encryption, but using a service adds another entity responsible for security.
