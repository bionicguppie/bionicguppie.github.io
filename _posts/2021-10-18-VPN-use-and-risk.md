## VPNs provide better security over the internet, but have their own security risks

### How does a VPN keep a network safe?

Encryption. VPNs ensure that a device can access a network only if it has the correct credentials to do so. It keeps the communications secure. All communication between the connected devices over the open internet is encrypted using very complex mathematical algorithms which obscure the actual data being sent. This means that if someone does intercept the packets, it would take a large amount of processing power or a very long time to be able to decrypt the messages. In general, the energy needed isn't worth it to try to brute force decrypt the message.  

### What risks are associated with VPN's

Physical VPN's – limited capacity, not scalable. If you have a sudden increase in users needing VPNs, like when many people started working from home last year, physical VPNs won't be able to accommodate all the connections needed. A company will need to purchase more VPNs, or have users connecting to your network in a less secure manner.  

Slows down internet speeds for users which can lead to users not using the VPN connection except when there is no other choice. 

Designed to create a temporary connection to the network, if a malicious actor gains access to the VPN, they have access to the whole network 

Not designed with Zero Trust in mind. Zero Trust is a security concept that takes the perspective that connections inside and outside of a network shouldn't be inherently trusted, and every connection needs to be verified before granting access.  

Can't set policies for end users – all or nothing connection.

This article makes a case that VPNs aren't secure enough and another solution is needed, talks about limitations of VPN's, doesn't really name a replacement, and the cloud solutions seem to be virtual VPNs
